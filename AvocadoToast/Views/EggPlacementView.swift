// TODO:
// restrict dragging of egg to bounds of ZStack
// check line 70

// this view struct will allow a user to drag an egg
// on top of their toast to place it where they would
// like it to go

struct EggPlacementView: View {
	// @Binding to keep track of the accumulated egg's translation
	// since @GestureState returns back to its initial
	// state - this property will keep track of our
	// accumulated drag translation and update the view's
	// offset accordingly
	@Binding var eggLocation: CGSize
		
	// @GestureState is a property wrapper meant to work
	// specifically with types that conform to Gesture
	// one of the perks of using it is that it returns to
	// its initial value after the gesture event
	// this perk is especially helpful in our case since
	// the only time the value of this property != 0 is
	// when it is being updated in the DragGesture .updating
	@GestureState private var dragOffset: CGSize = .zero
	
	// our drag gesture - keeping type hidden using opaque
	// type but compiler knows
	private var dragGesture: some Gesture {
		DragGesture()
			.updating($dragOffset) { (value, state, transaction) in
				// maintaining property state as user drags
				// state will return back to initial value
				// after drag (gesture) event
				state = value.translation
				print(value.translation)
			}
			.onEnded { val in
				// update our @Binding that's keeping track of
				// the accumulated translation so we can update
				// the offset of the view accordingly
				self.eggLocation.width += val.translation.width
				self.eggLocation.height += val.translation.height

		// setting flexible height for ZStack frame as current solution to TODO
		// this allows user to place egg nearly anywhere on screen (vertically)
		// and still be able to interact with it
		// before - the ZStack was the height of the largest Image (the bread)
		// and if user dragged the egg outside the bounds - then they couldn't
		// interact with it
		// overall, I want to remove setting flexible height for frame and instead
		// prevent dragging outside the bounds of the view
