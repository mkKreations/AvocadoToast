# WWDC 2019 - SwiftUI Essentials


## Description

This app is the product of following along with Apple iOS developers from the WWDC 2019 conference, 
where SwiftUI and other frameworks, such as Combine, were first introduced. This app is a tab view
that allows a user to place an order, with details such as adding toppings, changing quantity, and 
placing the egg.  In addition, the user can see previously placed orders as well as details associated
with that order.


## Features

- Uses property wrappers to maintain state of property
values and update UI accordingly
- Uses struct/classes appropriately to maintain state 
of data
- Uses small, reusable View components
- Allows user to drag image to desired location and 
maintains location state 
- Uses custom assets


## Disclaimer

Some issues identified:

- Egg can be placed outside bounds of Bread
- Navigating to Picker causing jump in UI (Problem with SwiftUI)
